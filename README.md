# KISKA ZYAADA BADA

> **"Who has the bigger one?"** - A High-Volatility Magnitude Duel Simulation.

This project is a React-based simulation game that pits two contenders against each other in a battle of magnitude accumulation. Using "convergence math" and "wavy interpolation," it visualizes how small differences in starting conditions (weights) can compound over time—or be negated by sheer luck.

## Features

- **Dynamic Visuals**: Real-time charting of player scores with a smooth, premium aesthetic.
- **Sound Engine**: Procedurally generated audio for chip growth and jackpot events.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How to Play

1. **Set Contenders**: Name your players (e.g., "BTC" vs "ETH").
2. **Adjust Weights**: Use the sliders to give one player a statistical advantage (or handicap).
3. **Start Duel**: Watch the curves evolve in real-time.
